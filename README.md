# Module 11 UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Project
For this project, we used JavaScript to create a table to display UFO data into a list or array. We filtered data to be displayed using HTML and JavaScript in a dynamic way. We created filters for multiple data points, including city, state, and a description of the UFO sighting. We made the data easy for the user to filter. We created a beautifully designed and simple interface that is easy for a user to interact with. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some of the challenges I encountered was going through this module was learning the syntax of JavaScript. Familiarizing myself with D3 was both a challenge and exciting to see and experience the JavaScript functionality. I found the filtering to be useful and I was very impressed with the website that resulted from our process. I did reach out to reinforce some understanding and did spend some time learning what the commands and functions in JavaScript were doing. It was interesting to learn how to debug my code using the console and displaying my page locally on my browser. It was fun experimenting with the data, using the various tools, such as Bootstrap, as well as comparing the differences and similarities between Python and JavaScript. The speed of JavaScript compared to that of Python was impressive and thoroughly enjoyed the process. 


## Results

The results were a simple, yet an quite attractive website that the user could interact with.

To use the website is simple! A user simply passes criteria into the search fields to filter the data. For example, in the image above, the date field was filtered by entering 1/4/2010 into the date search field. The change in that field triggered the table to be rebuilt with the new data that was filtered. 

## Summary

The project was a fun and challenging way to learn about the functionality of JavaScript and how it works with HTML and other web components. We were able to use existing data, create filters for data, and develop an attractive and dynamic user experience to display the data. It
